Dear Internets,

Placing too much information online creates a false sense of intimacy between strangers.  So, I think, on 
this public ReadMe file, which I'm only creating as part of a tutorial for GitHub, I'll include little to
no useful or Personally Identifiable Information. Even this username is kind of too much information. But
I'll choose to not worry too much about that.

With Regret,
FridgeDad
